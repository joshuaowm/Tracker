# Tracker | Python, HTML/CSS, JS, Bootstrap, Flask, Jinja, Leaflet.js, Pandas

## Description
**Tracker** is a straightforward web map application that enables users to visualize geographic coordinate data from CSV files as polylines or polygons on an interactive map. It draws inspiration from my very first GIS project, which involved visualizing manta tow tracing methods. This project was created as part of the CS50x program at Harvard University, utilizing a variety of tools, including Flask, Jinja, Pandas, and Leaflet.js.

## Key Features
- Upload CSV files containing latitude and longitude coordinates. Inside the "test_data" folder, you'll find sample data that you can use for testing and exploration.
- Display the uploaded data as polyline or polygon on an interactive map.
- Explore and interact with the map, allowing zooming in and out for more detailed views.
